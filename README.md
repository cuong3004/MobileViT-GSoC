## Description

* **Year**: 2022
* **Organisation**: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* **Project Title**: Publish fine-tuned MobileViT in TensorFlow Hub
TensorFlow Hub is the main TensorFlow model repository with thousands of pre-trained models with documentation, sample code and readily available to use or fine-tune. The idea behind the project is to develop new State-of-the-Art models like MobileViT and publish the pre-trained models on TensorFlow Hub using the ImageNet1k dataset. MobileViT is light-weight and general-purpose vision transformer for mobile devices. MobileViT presents a different perspective for the global processing of information with transformers, i.e., transformers as convolutions. Our results show that MobileViT significantly outperforms CNN- and ViT-based networks across different tasks and datasets. On the ImageNet-1k dataset, MobileViT achieves top-1 accuracy of 78.4% with about 6 million parameters, which is 3.2% and 6.2% more accurate than MobileNetv3 (CNN-based) and DeIT (ViT-based) for a similar number of parameters. On the MS-COCO object detection task, MobileViT is 5.7% more accurate than MobileNetv3 for a similar number of parameters.
